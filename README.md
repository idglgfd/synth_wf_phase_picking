# Seismic phases arrivals picking using a Deep Scattering Network
* The objective of this work is to construct a method for analyzing waveforms of signals obtained during microseismic monitoring using a neural network in order to localize the coordinates of the sources of seismic events, and their differentiation.

* Microseismic monitoring is one of the existing methods of analyzing the condition of the studied geophysical object: mineral deposits, large-scale industrial facilities, etc. It includes a system of sensors that detect weak seismic or acoustic signals, a data collection system and algorithms for their processing. The main task of monitoring is to determine the characteristics of a microseismic event: the time of the first entry, magnitude, and its location in space.
